Welcome to Crazy Car Jump Bonanza! This was a highschool project done as a replica of 'Crazy Taxi'

Your objective is to jump over and dodge cars, all while reaching the checkpoints within the given time limit. As your score increases, so does the difficulty.

This object-oriented, pseudo-3D game was made as a challenge on a API designed for 2D animation, so all depth and distance simulation has been done mathematically.

Highscore board reads and writes using files and can organize data based on lexicography, score, or date.

Sound effects and music also included (weird start menu song, but kind of funny)

To run, simply clone or download this repository and run the .exe file.
